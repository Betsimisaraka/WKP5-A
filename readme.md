# Explanation about my work

1. Explanation about the thing that succeeded with my code

    - Most of the event delegations are working such us the more info button, the add a new recipe button and the submit button.

    - The modal also work quite well, the inner modal and the outer modal. And I can click outside to close them.

    - I can add a new recipe from the form in the list and I can see the more info.


1. The requirement of the project

   - I think most of my work meet the requirement, but some are not.

1. If I had more time I would make some additionnal enhancement such us 

    - cleaning my code, 
    - trying to make my steps and ingredients from the form to appear in the new recipe when I submit the form.

1. Areas of improvement

   - I still find it difficult to loop through the steps and the ingredients that is the reason why I couldn't make it appear in the new recipe. So I think that is the thing that I need to improve on.

`Notes`:    
    
    Don't leave any error in the console (Red error in the console).
    If there is some, I need to explain them.
